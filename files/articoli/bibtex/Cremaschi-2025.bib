 abstract = {Semantic Table Interpretation (STI) is essential for data analysis and knowledge graph construction. However, current solutions lack accessible interfaces for managing STI workflows. MantisTable UI has been developed as a modular, web-based platform designed to simplify STI processes through an intuitive interface and an extensible plugin system supporting data transformation and export. The tool enables annotation visualisation and integration of custom modules. Usability testing indicated high effectiveness and user satisfaction. Being open-source and publicly available, MantisTable UI offers a practical solution for enhancing semantic annotation and facilitating the semantic enrichment of tabular data.},
