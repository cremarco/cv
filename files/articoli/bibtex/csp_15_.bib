    abstract = { Limited accessibility to language resources and technologies represents a challenge for the analysis, preservation, and documentation of natural languages other than English. Linguistic Linked (Open) Data (LLOD) holds the promise to ease the creation, linking, and reuse of multilingual linguistic data across distributed and heterogeneous resources. However, individual language resources and technologies accommodate or target different linguistic description levels, e.g., morphology, syntax, phonology, and pragmatics. In this comprehensive survey, the state-of-the-art of multilinguality and LLOD is being represented with a particular focus on linguistic description levels, identifying open challenges and gaps as well as proposing an ideal ecosystem for multilingual LLOD across description levels. This survey seeks to contribute an introductory text for newcomers to the field of multilingual LLOD, uncover gaps and challenges to be tackled by the LLOD community in reference to linguistic description levels, and present a solid basis for a future best practice of multilingual LLOD across description levels. }
