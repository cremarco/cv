abstract="This chapter discusses the case of ongoing experiences in the field of Service Science. The experiences refer to the Italian SMART project producing a homonymous methodology, briefly described together with a discussion of its application as an instrument for developing and structuring initiatives in Service Science education and in the design of services in funded industrial research projects. The discussion follows a pragmatist perspective, focusing on the enactment of a ``funded experience'' by scholars, practitioners, and Service Science students.",
