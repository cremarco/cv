abstract="The paper presents MammoTab 25, a new dataset comprising approximately 838930 Wikipedia tables extracted from over 63 million English Wikipedia pages and semantically annotated through Wikidata. Each table in MammoTab 25 is accompanied by fine-grained metadata, including column typing, NIL flags, and statistics, and by four prompt templates, making the resource simultaneously suitable for training, fine-tuning, and stress-testing Large Language Models (LLMs). MammoTab 25 covers, in a single benchmark, all key challenges for the semantic interpretation of tables, such as disambiguation issues, homonymy and acronym presence, NIL-mentions, and large web-table sizes; the tags attached to every table let researchers isolate and diagnose specific failure cases with precision. The corpus is delivered with an open-source pipeline that can be rerun on future Wikipedia dumps, ensuring long-term sustainability and up-to-date annotations. MammoTab 25 already supports, and will continue to support, a public leaderboard that evaluates the Semantic Table Interpretation (STI) capabilities of state-of-the-art and upcoming LLMs, providing the community with a live yardstick of progress.",
