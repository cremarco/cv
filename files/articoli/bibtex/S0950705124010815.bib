abstract = {Recently, there has been an increasing interest in extracting and annotating tables on the Web. This activity allows the transformation of textual data into machine-readable formats to enable the execution of various artificial intelligence tasks, e.g., semantic search and dataset extension. Semantic Table Interpretation (STI) is the process of annotating elements in a table. The paper explores Semantic Table Interpretation, addressing the challenges of Entity Retrieval and Entity Disambiguation in the context of Knowledge Graphs (KGs). It introduces LamAPI, an Information Retrieval system with string/type-based filtering and s-elBat, an Entity Disambiguation technique that combines heuristic and ML-based approaches. By applying the acquired know-how in the field and extracting algorithms, techniques and components from our previous STI approaches and the state of the art, we have created a new platform capable of annotating any tabular data, ensuring a high level of quality.}
