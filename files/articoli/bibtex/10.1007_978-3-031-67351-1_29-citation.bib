abstract="This document addresses the problem of psychosis, a mental health condition that affects one's perception of reality. It delves into the symptoms, causes, and consequences of psychosis, which can lead to chronic conditions like schizophrenia. We specifically focus on its early stages, particularly on Ultra High Risk and First Episode of Psychosis patients. We propose a digital platform that integrates psycho-education, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, and a Token Economy system to improve the treatment of psychosis. The platform comprises a web-based patient management platform, a predictive model and decision support system, and a smartphone application for patients. We explore how e-health and the Token Economy can enhance psychiatric care by providing access, effectiveness, motivation, and engagement while using evidence-based tasks, gamification, feedback, and rewards to help patients achieve their therapeutic goals.",
