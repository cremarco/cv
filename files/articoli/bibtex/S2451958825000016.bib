abstract = {This paper explores the digitalisation of token economy principles within the context of mental health care, focusing on the PEnguIN application. As part of the Digital Intervention in Psychiatric and Psychological Services (DIPPS) project, the app aims to enhance therapeutic adherence among young patients experiencing Ultra-High Risk and First Episode Psychosis. It employs gamification elements, avatars, and a token economy system to foster engagement and self-expression. The study presents preliminary usability testing, employing a mixed-methods approach to assess the app’s acceptability and identify potential issues. The findings provide valuable insights for future developments in the digitisation of psychodiagnostic and psychiatric tools, contributing to innovative mental health therapy approaches through technology.}
