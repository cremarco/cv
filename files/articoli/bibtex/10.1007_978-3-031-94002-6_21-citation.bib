abstract="This study explores the educational potential of video game prototyping tools, specifically Fortnite Creative, for interface design within academic settings. As video games gain recognition as sophisticated digital media, interest in game interface design has surged among students and faculty. Traditional prototyping tools, such as Figma, are effective for web and app interfaces, but lack the immersive, interactive capabilities required for gaming environments. Fortnite Creative, with its integration of Unreal Engine assets, offers an accessible platform for designing and evaluating video game interfaces, supporting rapid prototyping and usability testing. This research presents a case study from a university project where Fortnite Creative was used to develop a Heads-Up Display (HUD), and wearable biometric sensor devices were employed to measure user engagement as a response to the proposed HUD. Findings demonstrate the educational value of Fortnite Creative, showcasing its potential for hands-on learning in interface design. These insights have informed updates to the Visual Communication and Interface Design curriculum at the University of Milan-Bicocca, where students now gain practical experience in game interface prototyping and user-centred evaluation.",
